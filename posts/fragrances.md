_'Perfume is like a new dress, it makes you quite simply marvelous'_, said Estee Lauder. Simply, fragrances make us feel pleasant. I was quite intrigued from childhood about fragrances.
Whenever I smelt a good fragrance, it not only made me feel good but also it associated a nostalgic feeling to that particular event/time. I remember when I was about 9-10 years old and I went to a concert at night and I think my brother or someone else was wearing a fragrance perhaps versace blue jeans that just smelt amazing and it made me enjoy the concert even more.
Now I think, if I smell that fragrance again, I will be transported back on the nostalgic train to that time of the concert and enjoy those memories.

Each fragrance is different, but all of them help us associate memories of our happy and important times. When we go on a trip or someplace to enjoy, we always take our cameras. They help us capture our timeless memories. But our brain is far more advanced and much better at reliving those memories by itself. Fragrances help us achieve that. Applying a favorite fragrance on the trip while enjoying helps us associate those long-lasting memories with it. Whenever we smell the fragrance again, we relive those times like just a second ago...
