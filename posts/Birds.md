Who doesn't love birds. Their big cute eyes and their slender body and small feet are to be amazed at! Some are the most intelligent such as Crow, parrot and some are as beautiful as the peacock.


At my home, in the early mornings, different birds including sparrow, bulbul arrive. Waking up to the chanting singing of the birds really connects with your soul. Each of them, more melodious than the previous. Some eat fruits and some grazing in my garden. To enjoy the experience, I take up a chair and sit in the garden. Watching them walk and sing really amazes me. Even if the sun comes up and the day starts to heat up, it is still worth watching them.  

They migrate towards the Northern Hemisphere to breed in the summer and towards the warmer regions in the winter. They also exhibit a certain interesting phenomenon, known as *_murmuration_*. Thousands of birds flying together in a whirling, smooth motion, while singing is very satisfying to watch. This mostly occurs towards the time of sunset. Birds also have a biological compass which allows them to navigate effectively by detecting Earth's magnetic field.

I really want to learn more about them. Their study is formally known as _*Ornithology*_. Sir Allama Iqbal, former South Asian, Muslim writer and philosopher also writes in his _nazm_ '__Jawab-e-Shikwa__', "_Be completely absorbed in listening to the laments of the nightingale_". Nightingale is also known as 'Bulbul', are known for their melodious singing. By reading up about them, it would amaze me everyday, further igniting my curiosity and allow me to write about them to preserve my personal experience with them. 

Looking at such creations, it makes us want to glorify their Creator, our Creator, the Creator of the universe, the One. It is natural to thank someone for a good deed and its also natural to thank the Creator of the Universe when looking at His Creation. After all, we all will leave this world one day, so why not live each day to its fullest, while exploring such creations, just waiting to be amazed everyday!
