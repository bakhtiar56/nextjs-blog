*Health is a thousand blessings*, is the quote we have been listening since childhood, although it did not make much sense when we were little, it makes a whole lot of sense now. As we grew up, we went through minor injuries, a bunch of fevers and other related incidents, and we realized it had a lot to do with our active lifestyle. We did play sports with friends and family but sport alone did not have much helpful effect on our body. Our body is like an instrument, unless you play it regularly and practice it, it is going to catch rust. Therefore ***Exercise*** is the activity, one must focus on, if one wants to live a better and longer life.  

Why do we need to exercise? What if I don't want to do any form of physically intensive task? Well, to answer these questions, let's think about our origin. It must be understood that our Creator has granted us uncountable blessings, one of the blessings I have is I can move my hand and type on keyboard, as I write this blog. Human health is another such blessing of our Creator and we should be ever-thankful for it. If we make our body fat and lazy, it does not reflect any gratitude to our Creator. Doesn't it feel curious about what it would be like to use 100% of our brain, break the limits of our mind and accomplish what has never been accomplished before? According to me, its recipe is to read books and fatigue our body with intense workout, in which our mind can not stop us from taking our body past its *breaking point*.


One of the key exercises, is the strengthening of the body core. It is one of the most important workout and none of the exercises can be performed correctly without it...+
